These are some basic programs. 
The source code are taken from https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/single/bgnet.html#clientserver

Please go through the link. It is pretty good.

SO,

Now you might be wondering how to run these programs.

Just download the Repo.

run the Makefile as make all

it will crease the objects of all the given program then you can run them.

to run the server/listener:

./[objectname] -p [PORT Number]

to run the client:

./[objectname] -h 127.xxx.xxx.xxx:[PORT Number]

to run the talker:

./[objectname] -h 127.xxx.xxx.xxx:[PORT Number] [Message]
